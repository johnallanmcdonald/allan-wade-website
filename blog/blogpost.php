            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">If your sales team is underperforming, then they are stopping you from achieving your goals, and they are ruining your business.</span></p>
            <p class="p1"><span class="s1">30 years in business has taught me four reasons why sales team underperform:</span></p>
            <ol>
                <li class="p1">No focus.</li>
                <li>No marketing.</li>
                <li>No support. &nbsp;</li>
                <li>No measurement.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Let&#39;s dig into the details:</p>
            <h2>Reason 1: Multi-tasking</h2>
            <p>We often think the ability to multi-task as a positive trait. In fact, we may be looking for these &ldquo;positive&rdquo; traits when hiring a new sales person. I want to convince you that multi-tasking is a negative trait that cripples self-esteem, team morale,&nbsp;productivity, and quality.</p>
            <p>There&rsquo;s a burden of research available today that explains why multitasking is a failed concept.&nbsp; In fact, Susan Weinschenk Ph.D. from <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-wise/201209/the-true-cost-multi-tasking">Psychology Today</a>&nbsp;states that:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>&ldquo;Recent estimates are that you can lose up to 40% of your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/productivity" title="Psychology Today looks at productivity">productivity</a> if you multi-task.&rdquo;&nbsp;(Weinschenk., 2012)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Sales people&nbsp;<span style="background-color: rgb(245, 246, 245);">are failing as a result of multitasking as they are</span>&nbsp;often required to split their time and focus on public relations, marketing, lead generation, lead nurturing, sales calls, and account management.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>A recent study and essay by Adam Gorlick, Director of Communications at the S<b>tanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR),</b>&nbsp;states that chronic multitaskers &quot;become suckers for irrelevancy,&quot; &quot;Everything distracts them.&quot;</p>
            <p>Multitasking can be the cause of sales ineffectiveness, low morale, and depression. &nbsp;In fact, chronic multitasking has an impact on cognitive ability and IQ (Gorlick, 2009). &nbsp;</p>
            <p>Focusing the team and discouraging multitasking can result in higher productivity, better quality, and improved morale.</p>
            <h2>Reason&nbsp;2: Lack of Marketing</h2>
            <p>Management teams and SMB business owners can have an incorrect view of marketing: a costly expense with little measurable ROI used to shore up shortcomings of weak salespeople.</p>
            <p>They couldn&rsquo;t be more wrong.&nbsp; Marketing is a vital part of business success.&nbsp; You need only ask someone that is successful to find out. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>Well-executed marketing results in great products, aware prospects, and customers, sales leads and successful companies.</p>
            <p>There is a symbiotic relationship between the Sales Team and the Marketing Team.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/">Hubspot</a>, a world leader in Inbound Marketing, prefers the hybridization of the two groups into a single&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/definition-smarketing-under-100-words">smarketing</a>&nbsp;team.&nbsp; They say that smarketing is &ldquo;the&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31067/How-to-Align-Sales-and-Marketing-for-Results-Not-Just-Harmony.aspx">alignment between your sales and marketing teams</a> created through frequent and direct communication between the two.&rdquo;&nbsp;(Kusinitz, 2015)</p>
            <p><strong>If marketing is a low priority for the management team or business owner, then your sales team will be forced to do the role. &nbsp;You&#39;ll find salespeople creating marketing literature, websites, doing inbound marketing and more; the sales team won&#39;t be selling because they will be marketing.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Dedicated marketing is the first step to successful selling.</strong></p>
            <h2>Reason 3: Lack of/No Support for your Salespeople</h2>
            <p>Do you bring on new sales people with lots of fanfare but little or no ongoing support? &nbsp;It can happen easily. &nbsp;Business owners direct their team to suit their needs and succeed in sales but new sales people, lacking the power of the owner, soon find that the organization is not set up for selling and find themselves floundering regardless of their confidence and capability.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Creating a sales organization that fully supports your sales team is no easy task but must be done to succeed. &nbsp;Core to that success is a focus, good marketing, and the Weekly Sales Meeting.</p>
            <p>An open and honest Weekly Sales Meeting will help them achieve success.&nbsp;During your Weekly Sales Meeting, you should be identifying, discussing and solving issues.&nbsp; Gino Wickman of <a href="https://www.eosworldwide.com/">EOSWorldwide</a> has coined the term IDS: Identify, Discuss, and Solve and it&rsquo;s part of his &ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/u5lUYseptlc">Level 10 Meeting</a>.&rdquo; (Wickman, 2014) &nbsp;Through this weekly process, all issues are dealt with, and the sale team is adequately supported.</p>
            <p><strong>This type of support sets up a win-win for your business.&nbsp; Together, as a team, you solve issues related to achieving sales goals.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A Weekly Sales Meeting with open and honest discussion around issues, to discuss and resolve them will improve your sales.</strong></p>
            <h2>Reason 4: Lack of Measurements of Important Sales Activities</h2>
            <p>An individual and team scorecard is crucial to having useful discussions with your sales team. You want both so you can focus on the identification and solving of issues related to sales.&nbsp; Your sales scorecard should reflect the two to five key deliverables for each person.&nbsp; In the case of the prospector, you may want to know how many active connections they got, how many were qualified, and the call to prospect ratio.&nbsp; For the Account Executive it&rsquo;s all about the close and for the Account Manager it&rsquo;s about defections, re-signs and up-sales.&nbsp; In the first number column of the scorecard place the goal value.&nbsp; In the following 13 columns, put the values for each week, and you&rsquo;ll start to see trends. (see PDF download)</p>
            <p><strong>Become a scorecard centric organization, and you&rsquo;ll eliminate one reason to have sales failures.</strong></p>
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><span style="font-size: 15px;">Focus your sales team on what they do best.&nbsp; Some will be great Account Managers, (looking after existing customers and maintaining relationships), while others will be great Account Executives, (closers) and always be on the lookout for the prospector; the telephone warrior that is great at qualifying leads. Leveraging people&#39;s strengths, and keeping them focused will lead to higher morale, better quality and goal achievement.</span></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Consider either outsourcing your marketing or hiring a marketing specialist who can perform both the traditional marketing as well as excel at Inbound Marketing. Salespeople know the sequence; first you market then you sell.&nbsp;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Change the way you support your sales people. Create a weekly meeting, have the meeting at the same time each week, on the same day and use the same agenda. Make the meeting efficient and be sure to spend most of the time Identifying, Discussing and Solving issues.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Become a scorecard centric sales organization.&nbsp; Have each member of your sales team track the two to five critical measurements for their role.&nbsp; Then plot this information along with their weekly goal across thirteen weeks. It&rsquo;s much easier to identify issues when meaningful numbers are involved.</p>
                </li>
